## About the Home Assistant Community Day

In a nutshell, it's an opportunity to local community members. There is no set agenda by the Home Assistant team. It's up to us what we want to make out of the event.

## About the location

Looking Glass Lounge is a lovely Petworth neighborhood bar and restaurant. With the modest venue rental budget that Home Assistant is providing, I've been able to rent out the space, outside of their normal business hours, for the two hours before they open to the public at 5pm. They're also opening the kitchen and the bar for us, so please make sure to support them! There is a projector available for lightning talks--if we have some talks, I'll do my best to get it working! 🤞
