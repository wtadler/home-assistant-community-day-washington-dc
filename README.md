## About the Home Assistant Community Day

In a nutshell, it's an opportunity to local community members. There is no set agenda by the Home Assistant team. It's up to us what we want to make out of the event.

## About the location

As of 5/15, I am still reaching out to venues to see if any have a reservable private space, on Metro, within the budget that Home Assistant is giving me, with AV for lightning talks. It's not easy to find one! Raise an issue if you have some ideas! If it doesn't work out, there will be plenty of good options without AV; so we'll just scratch the lightning talks.
